## Peer-Reviewed Publications

**Alarm Forecasting in Natural Gas Pipelines**  
*Quinn, C.O.; Povinelli, R.J.; Corliss, G.F. Energies, 2020.* [DOI: 10.3390/en28261843](https://doi.org/10.3390/en28261843)  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a set of methods to predict alarm conditions in natural gas pipelines using autoregressive models, exponential smoothing, and artificial neural networks. The goal is to improve operational safety and reduce downtime by providing advance warning of gas quality threshold violations. The neural network model achieved the best forecasting performance.

**Cross-Temporal Hierarchical Forecast Reconciliation of Natural Gas Demand**  
*Quinn, C.O.; Corliss, G.F.; Povinelli, R.J. Energies, 2024, 17, 3077.* [DOI: 10.3390/en17133077](https://doi.org/10.3390/en17133077)  
**Abstract:** This work proposes a new hierarchical reconciliation technique that operates simultaneously across temporal and spatial dimensions. Results show substantial improvements in both hourly and daily forecast coherence, outperforming traditional reconciliation methods like variance scaling.

**An Iterative Shifting Disaggregation Algorithm for Multi-Source, Irregularly Sampled, and Overlapped Time Series**  
*Quinn, C.O.; Brown, R.H.; Corliss, G.F.; Povinelli, R.J. Sensors, 2025, 25, 895.* [DOI: 10.3390/s25030895](https://doi.org/10.3390/s25030895)  
**Abstract:** This study introduces a novel disaggregation algorithm for transforming multiple overlapping and irregular time series into a unified high-resolution signal. The proposed approach is validated using energy consumption data and demonstrates significant improvements in weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE).

**Inferring Daily Gas Consumption from Multiple Nonuniformly Sampled Billing Cycles with Hierarchical Constraints**  
*Quinn, C.O. Doctoral Dissertation, Marquette University, 2025.* [Available online](https://epublications.marquette.edu/dissertations_mu/3315)  
**Abstract:** This dissertation addresses challenges in natural gas forecasting by introducing three innovations: the Iterative Shifting Disaggregation algorithm, single-dimension hierarchical reconciliation, and cross-temporal hierarchical forecast reconciliation. Together, these techniques improve the accuracy and coherence of daily gas demand forecasts across multiple customer classes and geographies.
